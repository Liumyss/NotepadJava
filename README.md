# Overview

This program is a basic Notepad made with Java. The goal of this program is to show
how Java can be useful to create simple frames and basic software like a Notepad for
example. This program only focuses in basic user actions like editing a file, saving
it and open a new one. The use can also use some keyboard shortcuts while using the
software.

This program is a great opportunity to show how Java can be simple to handle simple
programs like this, but also lead to more complex programs. OOP (Object-Oriented
Programming) is also a good part of Java to understand it better and make it more
structured.
